## Dataset

The project uses the **Write & Improve + LOCNESS v2.1** dataset from the [BEA-2019 Shared Task](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/bea2019st/#data). This dataset consists of learner-written English annotated with grammatical corrections, making it ideal for GEC tasks.

##  Evaluation

Evaluate model performance using:

- **F0.5 score**, which weights precision twice as much as recall.
- **GLEU score**, a GEC-specific metric adapted from BLEU for better alignment with human judgments.
